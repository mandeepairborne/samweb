**I work on hadronic physics using theoretical models and computational tools.** This helps us understand the basic structure of particles.

My work involves:

1. Analyzing particle distributions using mathematical models  
2. Running physics simulations with Fortran and Mathematica  
3. Working with generalized parton distributions (GPDs)

Right now, I'm studying <span class="special"><span>h</span><span>a</span><span>d</span><span>r</span><span>o</span><span>n</span><span>s</span></span> to better understand their internal structure and behavior.

          <p>We investigate quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in this study by computing chiral-even generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at twist-3 in the framework of the light-front quark-diquark model, particularly in the zero skewness scenario. We provide a detailed examination of twist-3 chiral-even GPDs, illustrating their behavior through extensive two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) visualizations, which demonstrate their dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction (ùë•) and the momentum transfer (ùë°). Our investigation also reveals the intricate relationships between these GPDs and other distribution functions such as generalized transverse-momentum dependent distributions, transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions, and parton distribution functions (PDFs). Our study also includes the connected form factors at this twist, which are crucial in understanding the internal structure of hadrons. Additionally, we provide impact parameter-dependent PDF plots to offer insights into the spatial distribution of partons.</p>

          <p>This study investigates the subleading twist generalized transverse momentum dependent distributions (GTMDs) of a proton within the light-front quark-diquark model framework. We solve the parametrization equations for the Dirac matrix structure, yielding explicit GTMD expressions for both scalar and vector diquark configurations, leading to expressions for active ùë¢ and ùëë quarks. This analysis addresses the multidimensional nature of GTMDs by exploring their dependencies on one or two variables while keeping others fixed. Additionally, we extract transverse momentum dependent form factors from GTMDs by integrating over the longitudinal momentum fraction ùë•. The study uses three-dimensional plots to illustrate the variation of transverse momentum dependent form factors with the quark‚Äôs transverse momentum <span>&#120466;</span> and the transverse momentum transfer to the proton <span>&#120466;</span>.</p>
