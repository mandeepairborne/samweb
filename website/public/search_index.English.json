We provide a detailed examination of twist-3 chiral-even GPDs, illustrating their behavior through extensive two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) visualizations, which demonstrate their dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction (ùë•) and the momentum transfer (ùë°). Our investigation also reveals the intricate relationships between these GPDs and other distribution functions such as generalized transverse-momentum dependent distributions, transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions, and parton distribution functions (PDFs). Our study also includes the connected form factors at this twist, which are crucial in understanding the internal structure of hadrons. Additionally, we provide impact parameter-dependent PDF plots to offer insights into the spatial distribution of partons.\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        PhysRevD\n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Unraveling subleading twist GTMDs of proton using light-front quark-diquark model\n          \n        \n        \n          Shubham Sharma ‚àó‚Ä†\n          Sameer Jain ‚àó\n          Harleen Dhaiya\n        \n        \n          PDF\n        \n        \n          Abstract\n          This study investigates the subleading twist generalized transverse momentum dependent distributions (GTMDs) of a proton within the light-front quark-diquark model framework. We solve the parametrization equations for the Dirac matrix structure, yielding explicit GTMD expressions for both scalar and vector diquark configurations, leading to expressions for active ùë¢ and ùëë quarks. This analysis addresses the multidimensional nature of GTMDs by exploring their dependencies on one or two variables while keeping others fixed. Additionally, we extract transverse momentum dependent form factors from GTMDs by integrating over the longitudinal momentum fraction ùë•.
